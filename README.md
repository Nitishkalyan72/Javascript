# Javascript

"I'm looking for a comprehensive review of JavaScript, starting from the basics. Additionally, I'd like guidance on saving my code online, preferably on GitHub, for easy access by others. Furthermore, I'm interested in refining my JavaScript code and would appreciate detailed descriptions to help me incorporate new features effectively."
